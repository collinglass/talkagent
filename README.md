# Talk agent

Talk agent is an assignment for my OS class. It models two people talking
over an open connection. There are two talk agents used to handle the interaction from each person. The communication is realized through a series of pipes. ```Fork()``` was used to run Person B and Talk Agent B methods on a different process.

# Usage

```
$ make
$ ./persons
```
